# Encapsulation is the idea that we can group code together into objects; 
# hence Object Oriented Programming. We use classes or "coding blue prints" 
# to define what our objects are and how they behave. We encapsulate attributes 
# and methods in our class.
#class CoffeeM:
#    def __init__(self,name):
#        self.name = name
#        self.water_temp = 200
#    def brew_now(self,beans):
#        print(f"Using {beans}!")
#        print("Brew now brown cow!")
#    def clean(self):
#        print("Cleaning!")

# Inheritance is the idea that we pass along attributes and methods from one class 
# into a "sub-class" or child class, and not have to re-write the code to make it work.
# Child classes can be more specific versions of their Parent class.
# Using the key word "super" will call methods
#class CappuccinoM( CoffeeM ):
#    def __init__(self,name):
#        super().__init__(name)
#        self.milk = "whole"
#    def make_cappuccino(self,beans):
#        super().brew_now(beans)
#        print("Frothy!!!")

# Polymorphism means "many forms", and the idea in OOP is that a Child class can have a 
# different version of a method than the Parent class. In this example the child class of 
# CappuccinoM has a clean method, and so does CoffeeM. Depending on the class, the 
# clean method will do different things.
#class CappuccinoM( CoffeeM ):
#    def __init__(self,name):
#        super().__init__(name)
#        self.milk = "whole"
#    def make_cappuccino(self,beans):
#        super().brew_now(beans)
#        print("Frothy!!!")
#    def clean(self):
#        print("Cleaning the froth!")

# Abstraction is an extension of Encapsulation, and we can hide attributes or methods that 
# a Barista doesn't need to know about, like a CoffeeM. That way the Barista can make a cup 
# of coffee in a simpler manner.
#class Barista:
#    def __init__(self,name):
#        self.name = name
#        self.cafe = CoffeeM("Cafe")
#    def make_coffee(self):
#        self.cafe.brew_now()

#class Parent:
#    def method_a(self):
#        print("invoking Parent method_a!")
#class Child(Parent):
#    def method_a(self):
#        print("invoking Child method_a!")
#dad = Parent()
#son = Child()
#dad.method_a()
#son.method_a()

# We'll use the Person class to demonstrate polymorphism
# in which multiple classes inherit from the same class but behave in different ways
#class Person:
#  def pay_bill(self):
#      raise NotImplementedError
# Millionaire inherits from Person
#class Millionaire(Person):
#  def pay_bill(self):
#      print("Here you go! Keep the change!")
# Grad Student also inherits from the Person class

#  def pay_bill(self):
#      print("Can I owe you ten bucks or do the dishes?")

favorite_color = input('What is your favorite color? ')
